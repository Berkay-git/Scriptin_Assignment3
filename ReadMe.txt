We used Python version 3.13

We used Windows 11 operating system

All members contributed equally to this assignment. We divided tasks by admin side and client side. Berkay Ceylan was
responsible with creating admin operations while Murat Doruk Güneş was responsible with implementing client operations.
All remaining parts were discussed together and implemented together in IT. Additionally, we met up and went to the
house of Berkay Ceylan and continued to discuss and implement together. For example Berkay implemented skeleton of
"Register" page and Murat implemented requirements of the "Register" page, such as at least 10 characters are required
in the password, one uppercase and one lowercase letter requirement while registering and so on.

We mainly used WhatsApp and GitHub while we were working on this assignment. Before commiting to our GitHub repository,
every member showed extensive care by informing other group member. After a code is commited and pushed to GitHub other
member pulled the code and tested the code. Therefore, after a function or code piece is finished, other group member
immediately tested the whole functionality of the whole assignment. This way, both of the group members were fully
aware of the work done, missing or wrong code parts and problems in the assignment.

Some of the SQL queries were completely new to us, so we consulted to AI about database query of "Search" functionality.
We learned how to use "LIKE" keyword in SQL queries and "%keyword%" representation. Which were basically pattern matching
in database level.
